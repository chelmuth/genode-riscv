         =====================================================
         A place to store RISC-V board support code for Genode
         =====================================================

While the generic RISC-V implementation is located within Genode's main
repository (https://github.com/genodelabs/genode.git), this is the place where
board specific code outside of Genode's mainline is located.

To use this repository, you first need to obtain a clone of Genode:

! git clone https://github.com/genodelabs/genode.git genode

Now clone the _genode-riscv.git_ repository to _genode/repos/riscv_:

! git clone https://github.com/ssumpf/genode-riscv.git genode/repos/riscv

For building a board specification of the _riscv_ repository, the build-directory
configuration _etc/build.conf_ must be extended with the following line:

! REPOSITORIES += $(GENODE_DIR)/repos/riscv

To build a specific board, the _BOARD_ variable must be set either in
_etc/build.conf_ or at the command line, e.g.:

! make BOARD=migv core bootstrap

Currently available boards: 'migv'
